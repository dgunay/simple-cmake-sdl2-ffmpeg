just an attempt at making cmake work in the easiest ways possible, namely
in this order:

1. Can I get a typical src/ and include/ setup to compile and run?
2. Can I link to an installed library (like -lSDL2?)
3. Can I link to several shared libraries?
4. Can I make address sanitizer work?
5. Can I make it work cross-platform?
6. Can I compile another source tree directly into my code?
7. Can I do debug and release builds with different flags?
